let a = 10; 

let b = a; 

a = 0; 

// work it out in your head first why are the values set .

// values will be  
// a = 0 
// b = 10 

the point of this exercise is to pay attention to whats happening in my head jot down what I am thinking.
    let a = 10; 
        - declare a variable called a. - set it to 10
    let b = a; 
        - declare a variable called b. Set it to a 
        - a is 10 so b is 10 too 
    a = 0; 
        - Set the A value to 0 
    so a is now 0 and b is 10 

function duplicateSpreadsheet(original) {
    if (original.hasPendingChanges) {
        throw new Error('You need to save the file before duplication').;
    }
    let copy = {
        created: Date.now(), 
        author: original.author, 
        cells: original.cells, 
        metadata: original.metadata,
    };
    copy.metadata.title = 'Copy of ' + original.metadata.title; 
    return copy; 
}

this function duplicates a spreadsheet 
it throws a error if the original spreadsheet isnt saved 
it adds a "Copy of" to the new spreadsheets title
(this will actually also change the title of the original spreadsheet)

fix this bug
