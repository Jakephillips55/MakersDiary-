class FizzBuzz
  def play(number)
    string = ""
    string << "Fizz" if is_divisible_by?(3, number)
    string << "Buzz" if is_divisible_by?(5, number)
    string.empty? ? number : string
  end

  private

  def is_divisible_by?(divisor, number)
    number % divisor == 0
  end
end

this was originally broken due to maths and spelling errors (diveide by 1)


class Cipher
  def encode(plaintext, key)
    cipher = key.chars.uniq + (('a'..'z').to_a - key.chars)
    ciphertext_chars = plaintext.chars.map do |char|
    (65 + cipher.find_index(char)).chr
    end
    ciphertext_chars.join
  end

  def decode(ciphertext, key)
    cipher = key.chars.uniq + (('a'..'z').to_a - key.chars)
    plaintext_chars = ciphertext.chars.map do |char|

      cipher[char.ord - 65]
    end
    plaintext_chars.join
  end
end

this was broken due to - ... wrong type of statement changed it to be .. so it wasnt excluding Z
then it was broken due to char.ord - 65 being the wrong way round - doing 65 - 69 = -4 > so was looking at wrong index num
is now looking at correct index num
