so what are the moving parts of your program.

reminder - add two_sum chall to here -
explain how it works.

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].


def two_sum(nums, target)
  table = {}
  nums.each_with_index do |num, index|
    n = target - num
    if table.include?(n)
      return [table[n], index]
    else
      table[num] = index
    end
  end
end

how this works -> nums is passed through each with index
<!-- example of what each_with_index does > a=[11,22,31,224,44].each_with_index { |val,index| puts "index: #{index} for #{val}" if val < 30}
index: 0 for 11
index: 1 for 22
=>[11, 22, 31, 224, 44] -->
then the value of n is found by taking num from target, if the hash array table includes n return the value of table[n] with its index position.
else the value of table[num] is set to index 


  <!-- b
    def two_sum(nums,target)
      hash = Hash.new
      nums.each_with_index {|n,i| return [hash[n],i] if hash[n]!=nil; hash[target-n]=i }
    end -->

<!-- def two_sum(nums, target)
    search = Hash.new
    nums.each_with_index do |item,index|
        i = search[target-item]
        return [i, index] if i != nil
        search[item] = index
    end
end -->


<!-- input will be  > [2,7,11,15] and 9)
output will be > [0,1]  -->

#b explained
#  so how is this working --
#  1. If a+b = target, we call b is partner of a.
#  2. We allocate a hash table, hash[k] records the partner index of k.
#  3. Let's visit the array, if hash[ei] exists, means ei and the partner of ei both exists in array. So we just return it.
#  4. Any more?  Because there exists and only exists one result, so we needn't to do  anything out of loop body.
