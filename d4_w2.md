####EXTRACT CLASS
#https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring/extract-class

Benefits
This refactoring method will help maintain adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle. The code of your classes will be more obvious and understandable.

Single-responsibility classes are more reliable and tolerant of changes. For example, say that you have a class responsible for ten different things. When you change this class to make it better for one thing, you risk breaking it for the nine others.

Drawbacks
If you “overdo it” with this refactoring technique, you will have to resort to Inline Class.





how extract classes work a step by step guide


step 1 - *Determine what to extract*
          find logical units of data which are
          grouped together or operations which are
          performed on a subset of data
step 2 - *Create a New Class*
          extract operations and establish a link
          from the old to new class. This link might be
          bidirectional
step 3 - *Rename the Old Class*
          if the name of the old class is not fitting anymore
          consider renaming it.
step 4 - *Review each class*
          mainly for the interfaces and links, the goal
          should be minimally coupled classes; see if you can replace
          bidirectional with unidirectional.
step 5 - *Value vs Reference*
          Decide whether you would like to expose the new object as a
          value object (immutable), or a Reference object (may be modified)



Step 1: Determine what to extract
________________________________________

example class:

class DiaryEntry
  {
    private $previewTextRst;
    private $previewTextHtml;
    private $textRst;
    private $textHtml;

    // ...

    public function setPreviewText($rst, $html)
    {
        $this->previewTextRst = $rst;
        $this->previewTextHtml = $html;
    }

    public function setText($rst, $html)
    {
        $this->textRst = $rst;
        $this->textHtml = $html;
    }

    // ...
}

  }
here there is two sets of fields which are grouped together and some operations which only perform work on a specific subset of fields. In this example, it is very obvious since we also have some duplication which we can reduce by extracting a class.


Step 2: Extracting Class
_________________________

continue by introducing a new Text class and move the textRst and textHtml fields to it:
________________________

class Text
{
    private $rst;
    private $html;

    public function __construct($rst, $html)
    {
        $this->rst = $rst;
        $this->html = $html;
    }

    public function getRst()
    {
        return $this->rst;
    }

    public function getHtml()
    {
        return $this->html;
    }
}

class DiaryEntry
{
    private $previewText;
    private $text;

    public function setPreviewText($rst, $html)
    {
        $this->previewText = new Text($rst, $html);
    }

    public function setText($rst, $html)
    {
        $this->text = new Text($rst, $html);
    }
}

*Step 3: Rename old class*

In our case, the name of the old class is still fitting, we do not need to rename it. So, we will just skip this step.

Step 4: Review Interfaces and Links of each class
______________________
Our classes only have a unidirectional link,

#A relationship describes the dependency or connectivity between configuration items. A relationship can be either unidirectional or bidirectional. The results of a search are affected when relationships are bidirectional or unidirectional.

the Text class does not know where it is being used, and it also does not need to know. This also allows us to use the Text class in classes other than BlogPost. So, there is nothing to change here as well.

Step 5: Value Object vs. Reference Object

in general, prefer to use a value object as this limits the scope of how and when the object can be modified. In our case, we decided to use a value object: If the text is changed, a new object must be created. This way we ensure that any modification must go through the owning class, in our case DiaryEntry.



reminder
---> class Per
        def initialize(name)
          @name = name
          end
          end 
 Per.new("tom")

 = Per(key) + @name = tom
