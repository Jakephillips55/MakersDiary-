Today started as a good day!

Goal defining - should be around writing code ! less about i want to solve the problem.
whats the correct code for the question

ch 18 was hard > borris_bikes essentially the task was to prevent broken bikes being released after they were reported her is how I did it
def release_bike
  fail 'No bikes available' if empty?
  @bikes.pop
  bikes.each do |b|
    if b.working?
      b.delete(bike)
      return bike
    end
end
fail 'No bikes available'
end

so - what is this doing !
I am stating that bikes will fail and print the error message 'No bikes available' if it matches the method empty? (defined later)
@bike.pop > instance variable of bike is passed through the pop method*
bikes.each iterates over each variable in bikes array with |b| and checks if b.working? (def working? return true end)
if b.working? *true* b.delete(bike) and then return value of bike so if bike is not working it will return the raise_error 'No bikes available' 
#pop > Removes the last element from self and returns it, or nil if the array is empty.
#If a number n is given, returns an array of the last n elements (or less) just like array.slice!(-n, n) does. See also Array#push for the opposite effect.

#a = [ "a", "b", "c", "d" ]
#a.pop     #=> "d"
#a.pop(2)  #=> ["b", "c"]
#a         #=> ["a"]
