[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.map { |num| num + 1 }

why > value of arr is set to the array, arr.map tells the code to go over each element in the array, value of num is set to each num in array, completes question of what is value of num + 1.

[1, 3, 5, 4, 2] => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

[1, 3, 5, 4, 2].sort

why > .sort is a method that organises the variables here alphanumerically (if thats not the correct word Jake 1-100 conveys the same concept)

[1, 3, 5, 4, 2] => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

arr = [1, 3, 5, 4, 2].sort.map { |num| num + 1 }

why > continuation of the first question runs iteration over the sorted array. adds one to each value


[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].sum
why > finds the sum of each element in array.

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 30 (twice the sum)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].sum * 2
why > * is times or x  (1x1)

{ a: 1, b: 2 } => { a: 2, b: 3 }

hash = {a: 1, b: 2 }.map { |k,v| [k, v + 1] }.to_h

why > useful post in the which way is best link. basically - your iterating each value of each hash with the calculation +1 and then converting it back to hash

{ a: 2, b: 5, c: 1 } => { a: 1, b: 2, c: 5 }

hash.to_a.transpose.map(&:sort).transpose.to_h
why > this one was required learning >> heres how this works
First array-ify the hash into key/value pairs
hash.to_a [[:a, 2], [:b, 5], [:c, 1]]

 Then transpose to group the keys and values together
hash.to_a.transpose
 [[:a, :b, :c], [2, 5, 1]]

 Then sort the keys and values separately
hash.to_a.transpose.map(&:sort)
 [[:a, :b, :c], [1, 2, 5]]

 And transpose again to get key/value pairs
hash.to_a.transpose.map(&:sort).transpose
 [[:a, 1], [:b, 2], [:c, 5]]

 And combine the array of key/value pairs into a hash
hash.to_a.transpose.map(&:sort).transpose.to_h
 {:a=>1, :b=>2, :c=>5}
You could also manually do the hash.to_a.transpose step like this:

[hash.keys, hash.values].map(&:sort).transpose.to_h
You don't even have to assume that #keys and #values will produce arrays in any particular order since you're sorting everything anyway.

{ a: 2, b: 5, c: 1 } => [1, 2, 5]

hash = { a: 2, b: 5, c: 1 }.values.sort

why > calling .values on a hash will dispaly only the values .sort will organise those values.
