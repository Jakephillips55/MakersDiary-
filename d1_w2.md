**CLAP** **CLAP** CODE REVEIW (session)

- as I cant see the screen (forgot glasses somehow will just make notes)
-> what did I learn / what did I teach others <-
------------------------------------------------
I taught others refactoring your ERROR msgs into a hash so that you do not physically need to change each error msg content and can just pull from a list.
Also I taught that .freeze is a method that makes its content immutable meaning it cannot be changed by other methods
*unsure if needed for hash will check with a coach*

I learned that - when reviewing code its smarter to state the code is doing something rather then you/#{name}
corrections of rspec (I'm becoming slightly more fluent)
how to check back over previous commits and checks via Git - VERY USEFUL -> allows for step by step dissection of code and work / coding methods. Also allows you to roll back to a commit you knew was correctly structured.

This is my array

[{:amount=>10, :gl_acct_id=>1, :alt_amount=>20}, {:amount=>20, :gl_acct_id=>2
, :alt_amount=>30}]

i want result

[{:amount => 30}] or {:amount = 30}

You can use inject to sum all the amounts. You can then just put the result back into a hash if you need to.

arr = [{:amount=>10, :gl_acct_id=>1, :alt_amount=>20}, {:amount=>20, :gl_acct_id=>2, :alt_amount=>30}]  

amount = arr.inject(0) {|sum, hash| sum + hash[:amount]} #=> 30
{:amount => amount} #=> {:amount => 30}

#alt method below

array.map { |h| h[:amount] }.sum

#a coach explained a different way
This is one way to do it:

a = {amount:10,gl_acct_id:1,alt_amount:20},{amount:20,gl_acct_id:2,alt_amount:30}

a.map {|h| h[:amount] }.reduce(:+)

However, I get the feeling that your object model is somewhat lacking. With a better object model, you would probably be able to do something like:

a.map(&:amount).reduce(:+)
Or even just

a.sum
Note that if you want to get out a Hash, you need to wrap it in a Hash again.

heres another way I wont explain it thats for you to do
*what is the below code doing*
[{
    :amount=>10,
    :gl_acct_id=>1,
    :alt_amount=>20
},{
    :amount=>20,
    :gl_acct_id=>2,
    :alt_amount=>30
}].sum { |t| t[:amount] }

#conjoins the 2 arrays with a , allowing you to call .sum on both hash arrays - you can then take the value of t into the key hash of amount and sum the 2 together.
