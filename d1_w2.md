**CLAP** **CLAP** CODE REVEIW (session)
i cant see the screen :(
- as I cant see the screen (forgot glasses somehow will just make notes)
-> what did I learn / what did I teach others <-
------------------------------------------------
I taught others refactoring your ERROR msgs into a hash so that you do not physically need to change each error msg content and can just pull from a list.
Also I taught that .freeze is a method that makes its content immutable meaning it cannot be changed by other methods
*unsure if needed for hash will check with a coach*

I learned that - when reviewing code its smarter to state the code is doing something rather then you/#{name}
corrections of rspec (I'm becoming slightly more fluent)
how to check back over previous commits and checks via Git - VERY USEFUL -> allows for step by step dissection of code and work / coding methods. Also allows you to roll back to a commit you knew was correctly structured.
