In a one-to-many relationship, each row in the related to table can be related to many rows in the relating table. This allows frequently used information to be saved only once in a table and referenced many times in all other tables. In a one-to-many relationship between Table A and Table B, each row in Table A is linked to 0, 1 or many rows in Table B. The number of rows in Table A is almost always less than the number of rows in Table B.
