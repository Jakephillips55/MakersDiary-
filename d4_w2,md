how extract classes work a step by step guide


step 1 - *Determine what to extract*
          find logical units of data which are
          grouped together or operations which are
          performed on a subset of data
step 2 - *Create a New Class*
          extract operations and establish a link
          from the old to new class. This link might be
          bidirectional
step 3 - *Rename the Old Class*
          if the name of the old class is not fitting anymore
          consider renaming it.
step 4 - *Review each class*
          mainly for the interfaces and links, the goal
          should be minimally coupled classes; see if you can replace
          bidirectional with unidirectional.
step 5 - *Value vs Reference*
          Decide whether you would like to expose the new object as a
          value object (immutable), or a Reference object (may be modified)
